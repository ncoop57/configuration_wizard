# VCDEP Configuration Wizard

## What does it do?

This is a supplemental tool for our VCDEP system. It allows for an instructor to easily setup multiple git repositories for students from a base git repository on GitHub. The main reason you would use this is if you are wanting to use our VCDEP tool in your class room and do not want to go through the manual process of setting up all of the repositories by hand.

## Requirements:

<ul>
<li>Must create a GitHub Organization. Documentation for doing so can be found <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch/">here</a></li>
<li>Must generate a Personal Access Token so that our application can make the required GitHub requests on your behalf. Documentation for doing so can be found <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/">here</a></li>
<li>Must have a bare repository stored locally on your machine. You are free to use your own, but feel free to check out our already created projects for <a href="https://github.com/ncoop57/php_activity">PHP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ncoop57/java_activity">Java</a></li>
</ul>
